A Dialogue between
Dick and Rohin:
OR,
Two merry country Coblers.

Dick.
_WEll met honest Robin, I am glad
that it is my fortune once more to
meete with, thee before thou art
hang'd?


Rob.
Why thou whorson Ras|call
dost thou thinke ever I make account to
be hang'd?


Dick.
I if thou beest not, I dare to bee hang'd
or thee, if ever thy wise bee pleasd.


Rob.
When my wife is pleas'd I thinke in
my conscience the world will bee at an end:
'sfoot I have such a wife as I thinke the devill
hath not such another in his dominion.



Dick.
Why, what atles her?


Rob.
Prethee Dick tell me, wast thou ever
in London?


Dick.
Yes that I have, what then?


Rob.
And didst thou ever heare a thing cald
Boe. bel ring there?


Dick.
Yes that I have by a good token, I
once walking in Cheap-side to buy three yards
of blacke pudding, the Bell made such a hum|ming
in my yeares, as if a thousand Tinkers
had beene at worke there.


Rob.
But didst thou sirrah Dick here my
Wife: when her tongue is upon the pinne of
scolding, (which is almost at all times)
thou wouldst thinke that thou wert a hun|ting
with the Devills Reagles, which
were scenting after a Citie Pettifogging
Lawyer.


Dick.
Is shee so well verst then in the art
of scoulding?


Rob.
I dare pawne my eares that O|vid
had never better skil in his de Arte A|mandi,


Dick.
Thou speakst Latin Robin.


Rob.
A foolish sentence which I have
heard often repeated, which they say in
our vulgar Translation, is the Art of
Love.



Dick.
I, but is Scoulding her worst
fault?


Rob.
No, hang her: I caught her not
long since lying chick by choule with a
Sattin Doublet.


Dick.
Thou art in iest art thou not?


Rob.
I cannot tel whether I am in iest
or no; but I am sure I found her making
me a Cuckold in good earnest. Nay, and
Ile tell thee what a tricke shee served mee
too: I like a good honest man, going to
make a dis-iunctive betwixt her and the Sat|tin
doublet, shee like a whore as shee was,
very orderly, leapes out of her bed, and
without any mercie at all, snatches up a
good handsome Crab-sticke, and belaboured
my iacket very handsomely, and when shee
had done, shee went to bed againe unto her
Sattin doublet, to whom shee lay very
closely.


Dick.
And what didst thou doe all the
while?


Rob.
Faith Ile tell thee, when I saw
there was no remedy, very faire and honestly
I lighted them with a Candle, for feare least
betwixt them they should make my hornes
grow crooked.



Dick.
Faith, thou hadst very hard fortune to
meet with her.


Rob.
Push, Ile tell thee more yet, when we
were married first, if I had given her the least
occasion which could bee, she would have been
up very earely in a morning, when her neigh|bours
did thinke like a good huswife shee had
beene up beating of her Bucks, she very coura|giously
was bumbasting of my poore Car|kasse?


Dick.
Can she fight so well?


Rob.
Faith for a little while I durst have
turn'd her loose to the strongest devill in hell
for about or two.


Dick.
And is shee as bad still?


Rob.
No, no, (God be thanked) the world's
well amended now.


Dick.
How didst thou doe to tame her?


Rob.
Ile tell you; at length being resolutely
bent with all the might and power I had, I
tide her up to racke and manger, where I kept
her so long fasting, untill shee swore never to
scold, or lift up her hand against mee any
more.


Dick.
And hath shee beene as good as her
word.


Rob.
Let her breake it when shee pleases, I
know the way how to feed her againe with the
same sauce.



Dick.
But leaving of this discourse concer|ning
thy wife: canst thou tell mee any newes
from abroad?


Rob.
'Faith Robin I can tell the none, but
can sing some.


Dick.
Prethee doe: but bee sure thou keepe
thy tongue within compasse.


Rob.
Let me alone for that: wherefore open
your eares.


Song.
Some say at London there is newes.
That great men transport over shooes,
(For which I'me sure the Countrey rues)
By whole sale.
Some say that Tradesmen are growne sad,
Because of late they were so mad,
To lose the thing which once they had,
True dealing.
And I doe also understand,
That Patentees must out of hand,
Bee banisht from our English land
For nimming.


Dick.
Art thou sure Robbin that there is no
harme in all this, art thou not out of compasse.



Rob.
As sure as I take this Can and
drinke to thee: I am sure there is no harme in
all this.


Dick.
Then prethee lets have the second part
to the same tune,


Rob.
A Bore I heare of late was caught,
For eating meate and leaving draffe,
He must be better manners taught
By cutting.
Some said in England was the Pope,
But I did ever better hope,
He should be first choakt in a rope,
You know where.


Dick.
I drinke to thee Robin, I am sure
there hath beene no harme in all this.


Rob.
More newes I have you yet to tell,
Wherefore I pray you marke it well,
Ile shew you what lately befell
To Robin:
He went so much upon the score,
That he could trusted be no more,
Wherefore he ranne out of the doore
Most swiftly.
From whence he went away to Sea,
Sure he was bitten with a Flea,
For he could not but pitty plea,
For cheating.

The Hostesse when her guest was gone,
Did wring her hands, and make great moane,
And many times did fetch a groan
For Robin.
O Robin thou art gone, quoth she,
And plaid the knave thou hast with me:
O that I were but now with thee
A scolding.
Then rapt she out an oath and swore,
That shee her purse would lend no more
To such as would runne on the score,
And cheat her.


Dick.
Why but Robin is thy names-sake
runne away?


Rob.
Yes faith Dick that he is, and it is re|ported,
that he fled as swift as if hee had beene
carryed in a Swallowes belly.


Dick.
Is't possible? Ile tell thee (Ro|bin)
hee was as faire a speecht fellow as
one should have heard speake in a Sommers
day.


Rob.
Ile warrant thee hee owed more
scores than one: or else I know that hee had
such friends as would not have suffered him
to runne away for so small a trifle as that
was.



Dick.
It may be so indeed: yet Robin, thou
hast kept within compasse, upon which I drink
to thee, that thou maist whet thy whistle: I
am sure that there is no harme in all this.


Rob.
Prethee Dick tell me why thou art so
cautious of being harmfull?


Dick.
So soone as thy song is ended, Ile tell
thee,
More newes I have yet to relate,
Tis not concerning any State,
But of a Knave and a make bate,
cald cut-throat.
His purse is full, and he doth wrong;
Alas! he hath lived too long:
But now he is in prison strong,
As some say.
He set his neighbours by the eares,
And put them in a thousand feares,
His poore wife she shed brinish teares,
For him knave.
He ruled them like as a Lord,
And bound them with a threefold cord,
And all upon his owne accord,
Most basely.
But now he singeth in a Cage,
A way to coole his fiery rage,
And some say he must tread a stage,
Cald Gallowes.



Dick.
This was a hundred to one (Robin)
Rich, cut throat of our parish.


Rob.
The very same.


Dick.
'Sfoot, I knew him very well, hee
was Constable once was he not?


Rob.
Yes that he was.


Dick.
Hee was a devillish domineering fel|low:
but a poxe on him, I have reason to re|member
him, through woefull experience.


Rob.
Why did hee ever doe thee any hurt?


Dick.
Yes; when hee was Constable hee
made me sit for three whole houres together
with my leg in a Pidgeon hole: looke if the
very print of the Stocks be not here still. Well
but if the Rope and he be marryed together, as
I live, Ile not mend a shooe, or boot, but will
make holiday on purpose to dance at his wed|ding.


Rob.
So will many a good fellow more be|sides
thy sefe: Ile tell thee, our whole Cor|poration
of Coblers are resolved that day not
to plucke a stitch.


Dick.
Hast thou any more newes to sing, I
am sure there hath beene no harme in all this?


Rob.
A little more, and then I conclude.


Dick.
Lets have it.



Rob.
As I was walking I did meet
Poore Iohn the Plough-man on his feet,
And as he went he did mee greet
Most kindly.
I askt him whither he did goe
So fast along? he full of woe,
Did say against a bended bow
To London.
He went to sue for his owne right,
For which he wronged was by might,
And forced for to take his flight
From his owne.
And now he sayd was his intent
To goe unto the Parliament,
To see if that he could present
His wronger.


Dick.
Faith he was the wiser for that, for
as I heard the poore man wronged is sure to be
righted there.


Rob.
Then by my consent al England should
goe thither.


Dick.
Nay but keepe within compasse, least
harme be found in that.


Rob.
You are still so cautions: I pray now
my song is ended, shew your reason for it.


Dick.
I will because I heare daily many bu|sie
fellowes talke about that which nothing
concernes them: as that such a Lord hath done

more than hee can answer, and such a one is
committed, and such a one, whilst the Pillory
tels him a tale, hee must lend an eare to it:
what have such poore shrubs as thou and I to
doe with such matters? let every Tub stand
upon his owne bottome; then may we talke
and spare not, and yet keepe within com|passe.


Rob.
Thou saist very true.


Dick.
Now I have shewed you my reason,
let us drinke the other pot, and sing thou the o|ther
Song, and so we will bequeath our selves
to our quiet rest.


Rob.
Listen to me then.

You that in quiet meane to sleepe,
Be sure your tongues yee silent keep,
For danger in a hole will creep,
By babling.
Meddle not with state affaires,
Nor those which sit in great mens chaires.
Lest that you chance to lose your eares
For lying.
If we bee merry sing a song,
Sweet and merry, not too long,
Drinke up your liquor good and strong
In silence.

So shall you sing and sleep secure,
So shall your mirth daily endure;
My counsell for to take be sure,
Good fellowes.
And so I bid you all good night:
If that my newes it have beene slight;
Ile tell you better when tis light,
And Sun-shine.
FINIS.
